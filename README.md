# 7H-SteamDeck-Fix
Streamlining the install process of 7th Heaven Canary on Steam Deck

Steps:
* Download FFNx from [here](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx/releases/download/1.14.0/FFNx-FF7_1998-v1.14.0.0.zip) and place it in the directory with these files
* Add non-steam game and refer to the installer
* Name it '7th Heaven' (Important! That's how I am able to find the APP_ID)
* Select ProtonGE under compatibility tab (I upgraded to GE7-45)
* Run it, change installation directory to 'C:\7th Heaven' (otherwise it won't want to run after the install) - Path has been changed with the latest RC)
* Run 7HFix.sh
* Copy Target path outputted by script when ended - change it on your Steam Library
* Run it - configure it - enjoy it
